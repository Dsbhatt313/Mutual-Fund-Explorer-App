# Mutual-Fund-Explorer-App

## 🚀 Project Overview
Mutual Fund Explorer is an interactive web application built to help investors and analysts discover and research Indian mutual funds. The app lets users:

1. Search AMC and mutual fund schemes across categories (debt/short-term/dynamic/etc.)

2. View real-time and historical NAV data (fetched and stored from AMFI / MFAPI)

3. Plot NAV movement and compare it side by side with Nifty 50 benchmark

4. View detailed risk/performance metrics: Alpha, Beta, Sharpe, Sortino, Std. Deviation

5. Get a suggested action ("Buy/Hold/Sell") based on returns vs. benchmark

6. All metrics, data loaders, and visualizations are automated and updated regularly

## 🏗️ Features
1. Clean, responsive UI built with Bootstrap-like CSS and custom JavaScript

2. Fast search/filter for AMCs or scheme names

3. Charts for NAV & benchmark comparison (via Chart.js)

4. In-depth risk metrics (Alpha, Beta, etc.), calculated using pandas/numpy on stored historical NAV & Nifty50 prices

5. Easy Data Freshness Tracking for users & admins

## 💾 Database Schema
Uses MySQL with three main tables:

1. mutual_funds: Holds latest NAV, ISINs, names, AMC, etc.

2. historical_nav: Daily historic NAVs for all tracked schemes

3. nifty50_data: Nifty50 historical OHLCV prices

4. scheme_metrics: Precomputed risk/return stats (alpha, beta, sharpe, etc.)

5. You will need to create these tables before running the app (see below).

## ⚙️ Data Sources
1. AMFI (India) — latest NAVs

2. MFAPI — for historical NAVs

3. Nifty 50 CSV — manual or sourced from investing.com or NSE

## 🛠️ Setup Guide
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+

2. MySQL server running locally

3. pip install the following:
    Flask mysql-connector-python pandas numpy APScheduler requests chart.js

### Steps
1. Clone this repository

2. Provision MySQL database

    sql
    CREATE DATABASE mf_database;
3. Load scheme master and Nifty50 data

    bash
    python load_data.py
    python load_nifty50.py
4. Backfill historical NAVs (via MFAPI.in, automated sleep between calls)

    bash
    python backfill_historical.py
5. Calculate metrics

    bash
    python calculate_metrics.py
6. (Optional) Run daily updater to keep NAVs refreshed

    The apscheduler job in app.py and data_updater.py does this on a scheduled basis

7. Run the Flask app

    bash
    python app.py
8. Open the browser:
    Go to http://localhost:5000

## ✨ Usage
1. Start at the homepage:

    Choose AMC → View schemes
    
    Select a fund to view full details

2. Fund details show: ISIN codes, Scheme code, NAV snapshots, NAV chart, performance vs. Nifty50, risk metrics, and a suggested action (Buy/Sell/Hold)

3. Risk metrics legend is provided for interpretation

## 📁 Customization & Extending
1. Add/modify schemes: Use cleaned_dataset.csv and reload

2. Add new benchmarks: Adapt code to include new index CSVs & DB tables

3. Performance Metrics: Tune your risk-free rate, comparison window, etc. in calculate_metrics.py

4. Improve UI: static/styles.css and static/script.js are fully flexible

5. Production: Remove debug, consider deploying with gunicorn/uwsgi, and secure database credentials!
